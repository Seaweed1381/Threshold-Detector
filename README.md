# Threshold-Detector
Threshold Detector for CRAYFIS


Version 3 now allows all .dng files to be included as an argument using *.dng using the -f option.  The -f option also allows for single .dng files to be picked.  Besides that, there is now an option to put all of the outputted .npz files into a certain directory, and if that directory does not exist, the program will create one.  Also, a hotcell mask was added.  I assumed for now that there is some .npz file that is called hot that contains information on the hotcells.
